Got it — here’s a **technical README draft** for OdinFold that captures your accuracy-boost plan, the novel parts, and makes it clear this is *your* architecture, not just an OpenFold fork.

# **OdinFold**

> **Ultra-Fast, Next-Gen Protein Folding Engine**
> *Combining MMseqs-speed, LLaMA-inspired attention, C++ inference kernels, and novel structure-aware token feedback to surpass AlphaFold2 accuracy.*

---

## **1. Objectives**

1. **Surpass AlphaFold2 Accuracy**

   * Target TM-score > 0.79 on CASP14 with MSA-free inference.
   * Maintain competitive RMSD and GDT-TS, especially on medium/hard targets.
   * Outperform on ligand-aware docking scenarios.

2. **Maintain or Improve Current Speed Advantage**

   * Preserve \~30× speedup over AlphaFold2 (sub-0.25s per target avg).
   * Full GPU and CPU optimization (C++ kernels, fused attention ops).

3. **Novel Architecture (Not a Fork)**

   * Incorporate **feedback loops** between sequence and structure tokens.
   * Introduce **geometry priors** as learned embeddings at runtime.
   * Implement adaptive sparse attention in triangular updates.

4. **Scalable & Deployable**

   * Support browser-side folding for small sequences (WASM build).
   * Optimize for cloud inference at <\$0.001 per 100 AA fold.

## **2. Key Innovations**

### **A. Bi-Directional Feedback Layer**

* 1D sequence embeddings ↔ 3D coordinate graph embeddings.
* Cross-attention heads pass information in both directions during mid-inference stages.
* Captures long-range dependencies earlier, stabilizing topology.

### **B. Adaptive Triangular Updates**

* Borrow **grouped query attention (GQA)** from LLaMA.
* Prune low-confidence residue pairs dynamically.
* Redistribute compute budget to high-likelihood contacts.

### **C. Structure Prior Token Injection**

* Lightweight auxiliary model predicts coarse topology (“fold class”) before Evoformer runs.
* Priors injected into attention bias → model starts folding with geometric hints.

### **D. LLaMA-Style Tokenization of Protein Graphs**

* Treat residue-residue distances and angles as “geometry tokens.”
* Pretrain OdinFold’s backbone on **graph language modeling tasks** before end-to-end structure regression.

### **E. Active Hard Example Mining**

* Automated loop identifies sequences with high predicted confidence but low TM-score vs truth.
* Adds them to fine-tuning batches to close generalization gaps.

### **F. C++ Engine Rewrite**

* Evoformer + Invariant Point Attention implemented in fused C++/CUDA kernels.
* Mixed precision: bfloat16 for early updates, FP32 for final coordinate projection.
* Single memory pass for sequence→pair→structure update.

## **4. Benchmark Goals**

| Metric         | AlphaFold2 | OdinFold Target | Status (Last Run) |
| -------------- | ---------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| TM-score avg   | 0.788      | ≥ 0.800         | 0.779             |
| Speedup        | 1×         | ≥ 25×           | 29.5×             |
| RMSD (Å)       | Baseline   | -10% error      | TBD               |
| MSA Dependency | Required   | None            | None              |

## **5. Development Roadmap**

* **Phase 1:** Implement Structure Prior Predictor and feedback layers.
* **Phase 2:** Replace triangular updates with adaptive sparse attention (C++ kernel).
* **Phase 3:** Pretrain on graph LM tasks; integrate active hard example miner.
* **Phase 4:** WASM build for short sequences; cloud inference optimizer.

## **6. License & Credits**

OdinFold is an original protein folding engine inspired by, but not a derivative fork of, OpenFold/AlphaFold architectures.
MMseqs concepts referenced for sequence compression; LLaMA concepts referenced for attention scaling.

If you want, I can now **expand this into an `ARCHITECTURE.md`** with diagrams, data flow, and pseudocode for each novel module — so you have both the README for public release *and* a deep technical spec for internal development. That will also make it easier to hand off to agents like Cursor or Augment for implementation.

Do you want me to go ahead and write that next?
