# Development Tasks and TODO Lists

This folder contains various task lists, development roadmaps, and TODO items for the OpenFold/OdinFold project.

## 📁 Files Overview

### Task Lists
- `before_multimer_tasks.md` - Tasks to complete before implementing multimer functionality
- `final_dev_tasks.md` - Final development tasks for project completion
- `more_tasks.md` - Additional development tasks and improvements
- `more_tasks_again.md` - Extended task list with more items
- `multimer_etc_tasks.md` - Tasks related to multimer implementation and other features

## 📋 Purpose

These files serve as:
- **Development roadmaps** - Organized lists of features to implement
- **Progress tracking** - Track what's been completed and what remains
