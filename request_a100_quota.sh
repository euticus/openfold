cat << EOF

RESEARCH PROJECT: FoldForever Protein Folding Benchmark
INSTITUTION: Research/Academic Use
DURATION: 3-6 months intensive research

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Large protein sequences (up to 900 amino acids)
- GPU memory requirements: 40-80GB for large sequences
- Comparative analysis against AlphaFold2, ESMFold, OpenFold
- Real CASP14 and CAMEO dataset evaluation
- Multiple model training and inference experiments

EXPECTED USAGE:
- 1-2 A100 nodes running 8-12 hours daily
- Estimated monthly cost: $1,000-2,000
- Non-production research workload
- Results will be published in academic papers

JUSTIFICATION:
- A100 80GB required for large protein sequences (>500 AA)
- Current quota insufficient for research requirements
- Time-sensitive research with publication deadlines
- Will contribute to open-source protein folding research

    DESCRIPTION="Request quota increase for protein folding research using FoldForever benchmark.

QUOTA REQUEST:
- Region: $region
- Quota Type: $quota_type
- Requested Limit: $quota_limit

BUSINESS JUSTIFICATION:
Research project benchmarking protein folding algorithms (FoldForever) against established baselines (AlphaFold2, ESMFold, OpenFold) using real CASP14 and CAMEO datasets.

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Large protein sequences (up to 900 amino acids)
- GPU memory requirements: 40-80GB for large sequences
- Comparative analysis requiring consistent hardware across models
- Research timeline: 3-6 months of intensive benchmarking

EXPECTED USAGE:
- 1-2 GPU nodes running 8-12 hours daily
- Estimated monthly cost: $1,000-2,000
- Non-production research workload
- Results will be published in academic research

Please approve this quota increase to enable critical protein folding research."
